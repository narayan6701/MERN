    <h1>This is something about CSS.</h1>
    <p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used to add styling to a html file. In CSS we create  a document which is used to add style to html page. Generally CSS is case insensitive, except for parts that are not under the control of CSS such as URLs, font names, IDs and classes.

    <p>
        To apply CSS to any element we use it as selector which is h1 here. And we create curly bracies which have tha property to alter and the value of property.

    Here property is color and it's value is red. We complete this property value by add a semicolon (;) last to it.

    There are many properties in CSS,but we only have to learn some basic properties. We can look for all CSS properties at mdn.
